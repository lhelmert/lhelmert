								<h2>Certified Online Business Manager</h2>
								<p>
									As certified Online Business Manager I help bloggers and
									business owners to reach larger milestones. I do this by
									strengthening the four pillars that make or break the health
									of your business: operations, launch- & project management,
									your team and money management.
								</p>
								<p>
									As former Finance Consultant I've successfully coached a
									three-digit-number of academic youngsters and entrepreneurs.
									Even though I enjoyed my job I missed working closer with my
									clients which lead to the transition to my current role. Now,
									I enjoy working with a handful of clients whom I can see
									sustainably grow their businesses day by day. Finally, I have
									also completed a Full Stack Developer Track to be able to
									fully dive into the process of creating digital products and I
									do enjoy blogging, too.
								</p>

								<p>
									Being half German-half Spanish I ended up being quite a
									combination between northern efficiency and southern kindness
									and a true global citizen by heart. As much as I love being
									grounded and at home, Iâ€™m always ready to pack my back and hop
									on the next plane/train/boat to broaden my horizons and put
									myself out of my comfort zone! Feel free to have a look on my
									travel blog, my passion project, in case you get curious what
									I am all about.
